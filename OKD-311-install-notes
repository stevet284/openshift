Install notes:

I have built clusters in the Linuxacademy playground, but these are time limited.
I prefer VMs on the laptop.

I've recently moved to using Microsoft hyper-v virtualition, I prefer it over virtualbox, the networking is simpler, 
a single nic gets to the internet but can also be used for ssh and can communicate with other VMs.

My VM has 6GB ram, this isn't really enough, but it works. 

Centos7 server install.

set hostname to use free dns name:

# hostnamectl set-hostname master.192.168.229.129.nip.io

# yum update -y

Install Epel and git:

# yum install epel-release git -y

Install docker from epel

# yum install docker -y

Install this version of ansible (not the one from Epel)

# yum install https://releases.ansible.com/ansible/rpm/release/epel-7-x86_64/ansible-2.7.10-1.el7.ans.noarch.rpm -y

Optional: Add separate disk and VG for docker
  # echo VG=docker-vg >> /etc/sysconfig/docker-storage-setup

# systemctl enable docker --now

install openshift from github:

# cd /opt

# git clone https://github.com/openshift/openshift-ansible.git

# cd /opt/openshift-ansible/

# git checkout release-3.11  


create /etc/ansible/hosts - see 3.11 host file example.

Update master hostname and default subdomain to match correct hostname:

openshift_master_default_subdomain=192.168.229.129.nip.io
[nodes]
master.192.168.229.129.nip.io openshift_node_group_name='node-config-all-in-one' openshift_schedulable=true

Create an ssh key and copy to autorized_keys so that the server can ssh to itself.
# ssh-keygen -t rsa
# cp -p /root/.ssh/id_rsa.pub /root/.ssh/authorized_keys


run the playbooks:


# ansible-playbook  /opt/openshift-ansible/playbooks/prerequisites.yml
# ansible-playbook  /opt/openshift-ansible/playbooks/deploy_cluster.yml

If all green, you should now have a working cluster:

# oc get nodes

For the GUI, you probably need to set an admin password:

# htpasswd -b /etc/origin/master/htpasswd admin admin

CONSOLE:  https://master.192.168.229.129.nip.io:8443/
